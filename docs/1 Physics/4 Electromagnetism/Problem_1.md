# 📘 Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force

---

## 🔎 1. Introduction

The **Lorentz force** is fundamental to the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields. It is defined as:

$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$

Where:

- $\vec{F}$: Force on the particle (N)  
- $q$: Charge of the particle (C)  
- $\vec{E}$: Electric field (V/m)  
- $\vec{v}$: Velocity of the particle (m/s)  
- $\vec{B}$: Magnetic field (T)

## ⚙️ 2. Why Is It Important?

The Lorentz force plays a key role in systems such as:

- 🔬 **Particle accelerators**  
- 🧪 **Mass spectrometers**  
- 🌌 **Astrophysical plasmas**  
- ⚡ **Plasma confinement in fusion devices**

## 🧭 3. Types of Motion

| Field Configuration         | Resulting Motion            |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Only $\vec{B}$              | Circular / helical path     |
| Only $\vec{E}$              | Linear acceleration         |
| $\vec{E} \parallel \vec{B}$ | Spiral acceleration         |
| $\vec{E} \perp \vec{B}$     | Drift motion ($\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ drift) |

## 📐 4. Key Physical Concepts

- **Larmor Radius**:

$$
r_L = \frac{mv_\perp}{qB}
$$

- **Cyclotron Frequency**:

$$
\omega_c = \frac{qB}{m}
$$

- **Drift Velocity (for crossed fields):**

$$
\vec{v}_d = \frac{\vec{E} \times \vec{B}}{B^2}
$$

## 🚀 5. Real-World Systems Using the Lorentz Force

### ✅ Cyclotrons

Particles spiral outward in a magnetic field while gaining energy from electric fields.

### ✅ Mass Spectrometers

Charged particles are separated based on curvature of their paths in known fields.

### ✅ Magnetic Confinement (Tokamaks)

Charged particles follow helical trajectories to remain confined inside plasma reactors.

## 📌 6. Simulation Goals

We aim to simulate and visualize:

1. Uniform magnetic field → Circular motion  
2. Combined electric and magnetic fields → Helical motion  
3. Crossed $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields → Drift motion  
4. Effects of varying:
   - $|\vec{E}|$, $|\vec{B}|$
   - Initial velocity
   - Particle charge and mass
