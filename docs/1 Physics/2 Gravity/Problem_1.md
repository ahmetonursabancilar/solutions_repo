---

### 🎯 **Motivation**

- Understanding how celestial bodies move helps us decode the structure and mechanics of the universe.
- Kepler’s Third Law offers a beautifully simple way to connect gravity, motion, and distance.
- It's crucial for:
  - Calculating satellite orbits
  - Estimating planetary distances
  - Understanding exoplanet systems

### 📐 **The Core Idea**

For circular orbits:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

Where:
- \( T \) is the orbital period (time to complete one orbit)
- \( r \) is the orbital radius (distance from the central body)

This means:
> The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius.

### 🧮 **Derivation of the Law**

Start with Newton's law of gravity and circular motion:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}
$$

The orbital period \( T \) is the time it takes to complete one orbit, so we can express it as:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}
$$

Now substitute \( v^2 \) into this equation:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M}
$$

✅ This confirms Kepler’s law from first principles!

#### 🌕 The Moon Around Earth
- Radius: \( 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \)  
- Period: ~27.3 days  
- $ T^2 \propto r^3 $ holds true!
  

#### ☀️ Planets in the Solar System

| Planet   | Orbital Radius (AU) | Period (Years) | \(T^2/r^3\) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Earth    | 1                    | 1              | ~1          |
| Mars     | 1.52                 | 1.88           | ~1          |
| Jupiter  | 5.20                 | 11.86          | ~1          |

🌟 **Conclusion:** The law holds remarkably well across the solar system.
