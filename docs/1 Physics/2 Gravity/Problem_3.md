### **Presentation: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth**

---



####  Introduction
- **Objective:** Analyze the trajectories of a payload released near Earth under different initial conditions.
- **Key Questions:**
  - How do initial velocity and altitude affect the trajectory?
  - What types of orbits (elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) can occur?
  - How does this relate to real-world applications like satellite deployment and escape missions?

---

####  Fundamental Concepts
- **Newton's Law of Gravitation:**
  $$
  F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
  $$
  - Describes the force between two masses.
- **Kepler's Laws:**
  - Elliptical orbits with Earth at one focus.
  - Equal areas swept in equal times.
  - Period squared proportional to semi-major axis cubed.
- **Escape Velocity:**
  $$
  v_{\text{escape}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
  $$
  - Minimum velocity to escape Earth's gravity.

---

####  Types of Trajectories
- **Elliptical Orbit:** Bound orbit with negative total energy ($E < 0$).
- **Parabolic Trajectory:** Boundary condition for escape ($E = 0$).
- **Hyperbolic Trajectory:** Unbound orbit with positive total energy ($E > 0$).

---

####  Numerical Simulation Overview
- **Approach:**
  - Solve equations of motion using numerical integration.
  - Use Python with `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.
- **Equations of Motion:**
  $$
  \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \mathbf{v}, \quad \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \mathbf{r}.
  $$

#### **Explanation of Graph 1**
- **Observations:**
  - **Trajectory 1 (Blue):** Circular orbit at 7800 m/s.
  - **Trajectories 2-5:** Elliptical orbits as velocity increases.
  - **Trajectory 6 (Brown):** Hyperbolic trajectory at 8300 m/s.
- **Insights:** Increasing velocity changes the orbit from circular to elliptical to hyperbolic.

### üìå **Graph Title:**
> **"Payload Trajectories from 800 km Altitude at Different Initial Velocities"**

---

### üìò **What the Graph Shows  :**

- The plot illustrates the paths (trajectories) of a payload launched **from 800 km above Earth's surface**, starting from the right side of the Earth.
- Each colored curve corresponds to a **different initial launch speed**, ranging from **5 km/s to 13 km/s**.
- **At lower velocities (e.g., 5 km/s)**, the payload **falls back to Earth** due to insufficient energy.
- **At moderate velocities (7‚Äì8 km/s)**, it enters **elliptical or circular orbits**, staying gravitationally bound to Earth.
- **At high velocities (above ~11.2 km/s)**, it follows a **hyperbolic trajectory**, meaning it **escapes Earth's gravitational pull**.

###  Interactive Quiz
**Title:** ü§î Quiz Time!  
**Question:** What happens if you release a payload from a rocket moving at exactly escape velocity?  
**Options:**
1. It orbits Earth in a perfect circle.
2. It follows a parabolic trajectory.
3. It escapes Earth's gravity immediately.
4. It falls back to Earth.

**Answer:**  
- **Correct Answer:** 2. It follows a parabolic trajectory.  
- **Explanation:** At exactly escape velocity, the payload has enough energy to escape Earth's gravity but not enough to move away indefinitely‚Äîit follows a parabolic path.

###  Gravity Well Visualization
**Title:** üåç Gravity Well Visualization  
**Content:**
- **Concept:** Imagine Earth as a deep well. Objects fall into the well unless they have enough energy to climb out.

from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Create a grid of points
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)

# Radius of the gravity well
r = 1 / (1 + 0.5 * np.sin(phi))

# Convert spherical coordinates to Cartesian
x = r * np.sin(phi) * np.cos(theta)
y = r * np.sin(phi) * np.sin(theta)
z = r * np.cos(phi)

# Plot
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(x, y, z, cmap='viridis')

ax.set_title("Gravity Well Visualization")
